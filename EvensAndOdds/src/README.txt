Hi, this is a console-based Java game based off the children's game "Odds and Evens". 
*-----Rules of the Game-----*
1) Before each round a player choose either odds or evens to bet on. 
This number is the parity (even/odd) of the sum in #2
2) Each player can choose to either throw one or two fingers each round.
The sum from all thrown fingers is the sum which will determine the winner.
3)Whichever player guessed the right parity wins that round
4 opt)This game can be played any odd number of rounds to find a winner, this program uses 3, but it could be 5 or 7.
